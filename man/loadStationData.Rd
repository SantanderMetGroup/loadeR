\usage{
loadStationData(dataset, file.format = "ascii", var, stationID = NULL,
  lonLim = NULL, latLim = NULL, season = NULL, years = NULL, tz = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A character string indicating the database to be accessed. This is usually a path to a local file or a URL 
pointing to a netCDF or NcML file in the case of netCDF and/or gridded datasets. For station data in standard ASCII format,
this is the path to the directory the dataset lives in.}

\item{file.format}{Wether the stations data are stored in a netCDF or ASCII (default) file. 
Currently only the standard \dQuote{ASCII} format supported. See references for details.}

\item{var}{Variable code (character string). This is the name of the variable according to the R standard naming
(see the next argument). For variables with vertical levels, the vertical level is specified next to the variable name followed
 by the \dQuote{@} symbol (e.g. \code{var = "z@700"} for geopotential heigth at 700 mb isobaric surface pressure level).
 It is also possible to enter the variable name as originally coded in the dataset to skip data homogenization.}

\item{stationID}{Optional. A character vector indicating the code names of the stations to be loaded.}

\item{lonLim}{Vector of length = 2, with minimum and maximum longitude coordinates, in decimal degrees, of the bounding box selected.
For single-point queries, a numeric value with the longitude coordinate. If \code{NULL} (default), the whole longitudinal range
 is selected (Note that this may lead to a large output object size).}

\item{latLim}{Same as \code{lonLim}, but for the selection of the latitudinal range.}

\item{season}{An integer vector specifying the desired season (in months, January = 1 ..., December = 12).
Options include one to several (contiguous) months. Default to \code{NULL}, indicating a full year selection (same as \code{season = 1:12}).}

\item{years}{Optional vector of years to select. Default (\code{NULL}) to all available years. If the requested variable is static (e.g. orography)
it will be ignored.}

\item{tz}{A time zone specification to be used for the conversion of dates, if one is required
(i.e., if the time zone of the dataset does not correspond to the system-specific one; see
\code{\link[base]{timezones}} for details). Default to unspecified (i.e. \code{tz = ""}).}
}
\value{
a list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{Variable}. Name of the variable
\item \code{Data}. A 2-D matrix containing the data. Dates are ordered by rows and Stations by columns, 
following the order indicated in the \code{Metadata}.
\item \code{xyCoords}. A 2-D matrix with longitude and latitudes of the stations
\item \code{Dates}. A list with the verification time interval of each record in the time series.
 This is represented by a list with two elements: \code{start} and \code{end}, representing the
 lower and upper bounds of the verification period
\item \code{Metadata}. A list of variable length depending on the available metadata associated
to each observation. If no metadata are provided, at least the station codes (compulsory) are displayed.
}

\description{
Load observations data from station datasets in standard ASCII format.
}
\note{
Unlike gridded datasets, station data do not use a dictionary for variable homogenization. Thus, users
must take care of variable units and eventual conversions when necessary.

\section{Geolocation parameters}{


 Regarding the selection of the spatial domain,
 it is possible to select the whole spatial domain of the dataset by defining the arguments \code{lonLim=NULL}
 and \code{latLim=NULL}. More often, rectangular domains are defined by the minimum and maximum coordinates
 in longitude and latitude (for instance \code{lonLim=c(-10,10)} and \code{latLim=c(35,45)} indicates a
 rectangular window centered in the Iberian Peninsula), and single grid-cell values
 (for instance \code{lonLim=-3.21} and \code{latLim=41.087} for retrieving the data in the closest grid
 point to the point coordinate -3.21E, 41.087N. In the last two cases, the function
 operates by finding the nearest (euclidean distance) grid-points to the coordinates introduced.
 
 In the case of station data (\code{\link{loadStationData}}), the logic is the same, taking into account that in the case
 of rectangular domains, all stations falling inside that window will be loaded. For single-point selections,
 the closest station will be chosen, and a note on-screen will inform about the distance from the selected point
 to the chosen station.
 
 In case of irregular grids (e.g. the typical RCM rotated pole projections), the regular coordinates are included in the
 \code{x} and \code{y} elements of the \code{xyCoords} list, while the corresponding geographical coordinates are insode two matrices inside 
 the \code{lon} and \code{lat} elements.
