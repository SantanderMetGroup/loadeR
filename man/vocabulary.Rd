\title{Standard definition of climate variables}
\format{A data frame with \emph{n} rows (the number of variables may change with the package 
version as new variables are included) and 3 variables.}
\description{
Definition of a standard naming convention (and units) for climate variables,
with the following elements:

\itemize{
  \item identifier. R standard name of the climate variable
  \item standard_name. description of the variable
  \item units. Standard variable units
}
}
\details{
The dictionary provides the reference names for variable homogenization. All the required
variable transformations to convert the original variable (as returned by \code{\link{dataInventory}}) and
the standard variables as denoted in the vocabulary's \code{identifier} are specified by simple parameters
in the \file{dictionary} (.dic) file.
}
\section{Variable homogenization}{
 The different nature of the various databases, models and variables, 
and the idiosyncratic naming and storage conventions often applied by the different 
modelling centres, makes necessary a previous homogeneization across datasets in 
order to implement a truly user-friendly toolbox for data access. 
This package achieves this aim by defining a common \code{\link{vocabulary}} to all 
climate datasets. The particular variables of each dataset are translated -and transformed if necessary- 
to the standard variables by means of a dictionary, provided by the argument \code{dictionary}.
In essence, the \file{dictionary} is a csv file particular for each individual dataset, 
containing the necessary information for performing the unit conversions to match the standard variable 
definitions contained in the \code{\link{vocabulary}}. This feature is described in more detail in 
\href{http://meteo.unican.es/trac/wiki/EcomsUdg/RPackage/Homogeneization}{this link}. You can also access 
an example dictionary of the built-in NCEP dataset of the current development version of \pkg{downscaleR}
