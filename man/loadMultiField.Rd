\title{Load several gridded variables}
\usage{
loadMultiField(dataset, vars, dictionary = TRUE, lonLim = NULL,
  latLim = NULL, season = NULL, years = NULL, time = "none",
  new.grid = list(x = NULL, y = NULL), interp.method = c("nearest",
  "bilinear"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A character string indicating the database to be accessed. This is usually a path to a local file or a URL
pointing to a netCDF or NcML file in the case of netCDF and/or gridded datasets. For station data in standard ASCII format,
this is the path to the directory the dataset lives in.}

\item{vars}{A character vector of length >= 2, specifying the names of the variables to be loaded. For variables with vertical
levels, the vertical level is specified next to the variable name followed by the \dQuote{@} symbol
(e.g. \code{var = "z@700"} for geopotential heigth at 700 mb isobaric surface pressure level). It is also possible
 to enter the variable names as originally coded in the dataset to skip data homogenization (see nect argument).}

\item{dictionary}{Default to TRUE, indicating that a dictionary is used and the .dic file is stored in the same path than the
dataset. If the .dic file is stored elsewhere, then the argument is the full path to the .dic file (including the extension,
e.g.: \code{"/path/to/the/dictionary_file.dic"}). This is the case for instance when the dataset is stored in a remote URL,
and we have a locally stored dictionary for that particular dataset. If FALSE no variable homogenization takes place,
and the raw variable, as originally stored in the dataset, will be returned. See details for dictionary specification.}

\item{lonLim}{Vector of length = 2, with minimum and maximum longitude coordinates, in decimal degrees, of the bounding box selected.
For single-point queries, a numeric value with the longitude coordinate. If \code{NULL} (default), the whole longitudinal range
 is selected (Note that this may lead to a large output object size).}

\item{latLim}{Same as \code{lonLim}, but for the selection of the latitudinal range.}

\item{season}{An integer vector specifying the desired season (in months, January = 1 ..., December = 12).
Options include one to several (contiguous) months. Default to \code{NULL}, indicating a full year selection (same as \code{season = 1:12}).}

\item{years}{Optional vector of years to select. Default (\code{NULL}) to all available years. If the requested variable is static (e.g. orography)
it will be ignored.}

\item{time}{A character vector indicating the temporal filtering/aggregation of the output data.
 (See \code{\link{loadGridData}} for further details). This vector should have
 the same length as the number of variables in \code{vars}, each one referring to the temporal aggregation of each one (See details).
. If a single value is assigned (default), then this is assumed to apply for all variables requested. Default to \code{"none"},
which returns the original time series as stored in the dataset for all the variables requested, but note that different time
 definitions for different variables may lead to incompatible fields to create a multifield (e.g. 6-hourly data without aggregation
  --\code{time = "none"}-- cannot be combined with daily mean variables because they would lead to time series of differing lengths).}

\item{new.grid}{Definition of the new grid, in the form of a list with the x and y components, in this order.
If no \code{new.grid} is introduced, then the grid of the first variable in \code{vars} is taken. See details.}

\item{interp.method}{Interpolation method. Currently acceted values are \code{"bilinear"} and \code{"nearest"}.
See \code{\link{interpGridData}} for details.}
}
\value{
A list of components similar to the output of \code{\link{loadGridData}}, excepting for the fact that within the
 \code{Variable} slot, there is more than one variables in the \code{varName} and \code{level} elements. Also, the N-dimensional
 array of the \code{Data} slot contains one additional dimension, corresponding to each of the variables loaded, following
  the order in the \code{Variable} slot info. In addition, the \code{Dates} element is now a list of the same length as the number
   of fields composing the multifield, containing each one the \code{start} and \code{end} dates for each variable (see details).
}
\description{
Load a set of selected variables from the same datasets for a common
spatio-temporal domain, typically to be used as predictors in a perfect-prog downscaling method.
}
\details{
In essence, the function does as many calls to \code{\link{loadGridData}} as variables indicated in
 the \code{vars} argument, and then performs the interpolation and/or spatial checks to ensure the spatial consistency, via
 \code{\link{interpGridData}}. See \code{\link{loadGridData}} for details on input parameters for time, geolocation and homogenization parameters.
If only one (either x or y, but not both) of the components of the \code{new.grid} are provided, the missing one will be
 inherited from the grid of the first variable in \code{vars}, via \code{\link{getGrid}}.
 \code{loadMultiField} allows the inclusion of predictors with different verification times and temporal aggregations
 (as often used in downscaling applications). For instance, instantaneous geopotential at 12:00 is compatible with
 mean daily surface temperature, always that both variables correspond to the same days. It is not possible to load
 variables of different time resolutions (for instance, 6-hourly data is incompatible with daily values, because their
 respective time series have different lengths).
