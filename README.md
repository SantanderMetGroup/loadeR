What is loadeR?
===============

`loadeR` is an R package for climate data data access and manipulation powered by NetCDF-Java (trough the `rJava` package). It allows:
 * Reading local and remote (OPeNDAP) climate datasets (NetCDF, Grib, HDF, etc.)
 * Creation of catalogs
 * Integration with the User Data Gateway ([UDG](http://www.meteo.unican.es/udg-wiki))
 * Basic data maniputation, homogeneization and spatiotemporal collocation.

Find out more about this package (including [installation information](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki/Installation)) in the [loadeR's WIKI](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki).

# `loadeR` within the **climate4R** Bundle

`loadeR` is a central building-block of the **climate4R bundle**, a set of user-oriented R packages fully integrated through a Common Data Model based on the data structure returned by `loadeR`. [See our paper](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/node/73360) in a special issue of Climate Services for an overview of the **climate4R Bundle** description.

THREDDS Data Server (TDS), the THREDDS Access Portal (TAP) and the climate4R
interface for data access and postprocessing, formed by several packages for data
access, transformation, bias adjustment and visualization and validation. Compat-
ibility with some external packages has been achieved by appropriate two-way
bridging functions (for the corresponding data structures). Arrows indicate data

## Other packages of the `climate4R` bundle

 * [`loadeR.ECOMS`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.ECOMS/) extends `loadeR` by providing harmonized access to ***seasonal and decadal forecast datasets*** from the [ECOMS](http://www.eu-ecoms.eu) initiative. More information in the [ECOMS-UDG web](https://meteo.unican.es/trac/wiki/udg/ecoms) and in the dedicated [*Climate Services* paper](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/node/73360) and its [companion vignette](http://meteo.unican.es/work/UDG/climate-services-manuscript.html) with worked examples.

 * [`transformeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR) is an R package for **climate data transformation** integrated with the `loadeR's` data structures. It includes tools for subsetting, aggregation, principal component/EOF analysis, regridding and more...

 * [`downscaleR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR/wiki) is an R package for **empirical-statistical downscaling** of daily data, including bias correction techniques.  
 
 * [`visualizeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR/wiki) is an R package implementing a set of advanced **visualization tools for forecast verification**.

 * [`loadeR.2nc`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.2nc/) provides support for **exporting to NetCDF**.
 
 * [`fireDanger`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/fireDanger), which implements the Canadian Fire Weather Index System for its direct application to `climate4R` grids, also in seasonal forecast applications. See this [*Climate Services* paper](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/node/73359), and a [vignette with worked examples](http://meteo.unican.es/work/fireDanger/ClimateServices2017.html).

 * [`drought4R`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/drought4R). A package for drought and potential evapotranspiration calculation seamlessly integrated in the climate4R bundle.
