#' @description Creates virtual datasets by modifying and combining other datasets via NcML.
#' @title Create a dataset from a collection of (netCDF) files
#' @import rJava
#' @details The NetCDF Markup Language (NcML) is an XML dialect that allows creating
#' CDM datasets (i.e.: any collection of scientific data which can be accessed
#' through the NetCDF-Java / CDM library). The NcML document refers to
#' another dataset called the referenced CDM dataset, generally composed on a
#' number of netCDF files (but also grib, hdf or many other binary file formats)
#' containing the geo-referenced data. This function creates a NcML file from
#' multiple CDM files that are conveniently combined ("aggregated") along the
#' selected dimension.
#' The use of NcML is not only intended for CDM file combination, and this function considers just a particular case.
#' NcML is a powerful, yet relatively simple way of dealing with large, complex datasets in a straightforward manner.
#' Among other capabilitities, NcML files can be generated in order to add/delete
#' metadata and variables to be renamed, added, deleted and restructured.
#' This function is intended for a simple operation of aggregation of collections of netCDF files,
#' as it is the most common case of gridded climate datasets.
#' @param source.dir Parent directory containing the files to be aggregated
#' @param ncml.file Full path of the output NcML file
#' @param file.ext Character string indicating the extension of the CDM datasets
#'  to be aggregated. Default to \code{nc} (netCDF).
#' @param aggr.dim Character string indicating the dimension along which the 
#' files will be concatenated. Default to \code{"time"}.
#' @param pattern An optional regular expression. Only file names which match the
#' regular expression will be considered in the aggregation 
#' (see \link[base]{regexp}). This argument can be useful in order to save time
#' when only a particular subset of variables from the whole collection is 
#' needed. Default to \code{NULL}, meaning that all files in the search path
#' are included (See next argument). See Notes.
#' @param recursive Logical. Should the listing of files to be aggregated recurse
#' into directories?. Default to \code{FALSE}. This is useful for instance when 
#' each variable is stored in a sepparate subdirectory.
#' @param verbose Logical. Should additional information of the NcML file creation
#' steps be printed on screen?. Default to \code{TRUE}.
#' @return Creates a NcML file at the specified location.
#' @export
#' @note The current implementation of the function only considers datasets in which each file stores
#' one single variable. For other dataset configurations, please refer to the NcML tutorial.
#' 
#' \emph{Wildcards} (or \emph{globbing}) patterns as used by most shells can be mapped to regular expression in R 
#' using \code{\link[utils]{glob2rx}}.
